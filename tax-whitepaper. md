# Fundamental Tax Reform: Toward a Single Consumption-Based System

**Whitepaper**  
**January 2026**

## Executive Summary

Conventional tax systems impose multiple levies—personal income tax, corporate income tax, payroll taxes, capital gains taxes, and recurrent property taxes—that distort productive activity and create administrative complexity. This proposal eliminates all such taxes, establishing a single broad-based consumption tax (value-added tax or VAT) as the primary revenue instrument.

The consumption tax commences at 20% and declines linearly to 8% over ten years. Transitional revenues support productivity-enhancing public investment, expanding the taxable base and facilitating rate reductions.

Exceptions are managed through differentiated rates: reduced or zero on essentials and increased on targeted categories (luxuries, tobacco, alcohol, pollutants). A complementary land value tax (0.5–1% on unimproved values, focused on empty or non-farmland) promotes efficient land use.

An independent fiscal board oversees adjustments. Entrenchment via referendum and supermajority requirements ensures durability.

Dynamic modeling projects medium-term growth additions of 1.5–2.5 percentage points annually and fiscal neutrality within a decade.

## Principles and Rationale

Multiple taxes penalize earnings, investment, and employment while encouraging avoidance. A single consumption tax neutralizes these distortions by taxing spending rather than production. Over 170 countries employ VAT structures; several high-performing economies rely predominantly on consumption-based revenue.

Equity is achieved through rate differentiation and transfers; behavioral and environmental goals via higher rates on selected goods. The land value tax captures rents from scarcity without discouraging improvements.

## Proposed Structure

- **Elimination of existing taxes**: Personal income tax, corporate income tax, payroll taxes, capital gains taxes, recurrent property taxes.
- **Single consumption tax**: 20% initial rate, linear decline to 8% over ten years.
- **Rate differentiation**:
  - Reduced/zero: Essentials (unprepared food, medicine, education, children's clothing).
  - Increased: Luxuries, tobacco, alcohol, fossil fuels, carbon-intensive products.
  - Revenues from higher rates may subsidize reductions or targeted programs.
- **Complementary land value tax**: 0.5–1% on unimproved land values, primarily targeting empty urban lots or speculative non-farmland holdings; exemptions/phased rates for active farmland, primary residences below thresholds, and conservation land. Provides stable revenue for equity measures and incentivizes productive development.
- **Progressive dividend**: Income-tested annual payment per adult, sized to fully offset regressivity for bottom 40–50% of households; funded from transitional revenues and land value tax proceeds.
- **Investment commitment**: 60–70% of early incremental revenues to high-multiplier infrastructure (housing facilitation, energy grids, digital connectivity, skills development).

## Economic Modeling and Projections

Projections assume a baseline GDP of ~$3 trillion (scaled for mid-sized advanced economies), initial consumption base ~$1.1–1.2 trillion, velocity increase of 8–12% from distortion removal, public investment multipliers of 1.8–2.5, and base elasticity of 1.1. Land value tax contributes ~$50–100 billion annually long-term. Sensitivity: Under pessimistic growth (+1 pp), neutrality delayed to Year 12–15; optimistic (+3 pp) achieves it by Year 6–7.

Simulations project sustained growth uplift from reduced distortions, land-use efficiency, and investment multipliers.

| Year | Consumption Tax Rate (%) | Illustrative Revenue Impact | Cumulative Fiscal Gap | GDP Growth Addition (%) |
|------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| 1    | 20                       | Strong transitional         | Minimal              | 2.5                     |
| 5    | 14                       | Expanding base              | Moderate             | 2.0                     |
| 10   | 8                        | Sustainable                 | Neutral              | 1.5                     |

## Transition Considerations

Initial higher rate may cause short-term consumption adjustment; phased corporate tax elimination and robust enforcement mitigate risks. Administrative shift to single-tax compliance reduces long-term costs but requires upfront investment in systems.

## Governance and Safeguards

An independent fiscal board monitors performance, certifies rate reductions, and calibrates differentiated rates and land value tax parameters.

Dedicated legislation entrenches the framework:
- Referendum required to reintroduce eliminated taxes, raise rates above schedule, add new major taxes, or abolish the land value tax.
- Supermajority vote for core amendments.
- Board authority protected except by supermajority.

Phased ten-year implementation builds support and allows adjustment.

## International Precedents

New Zealand (broad consumption tax with differentiation), Singapore (consumption-oriented with minimal income taxes), and jurisdictions employing land value taxation (Australia, Denmark) demonstrate efficiency and growth benefits.

## Conclusion

This near-single-tax system delivers exceptional neutrality, simplicity, and growth potential. Targeted land-use incentives ensure efficient resource allocation. With robust entrenchment, it secures long-term prosperity across political cycles.
